# valueperacre

This is a simple example of a value per acre analysis using a geojson collection of polygons, each with a vpa (value per acre) property. You can use mine if you're just looking for an example, or you can drop your own geojson data file in. Once you're ready to spin it up, go here and install a program called Simple Web Server:

Install and then run Simple Web Server and click 'New Server' in the bottom right. Add the valueperacre folder you've just downloaded and you're good to go. Go to your browser and type in 'http://localhost:8080/choropleth.html'. Go there an you'll see the deck.gl magic in action.

My Oceanside data has 60,000 parcels, which is huge. Your data might either be better optimized or have fewer parcels, in which case the map will be snappier.
